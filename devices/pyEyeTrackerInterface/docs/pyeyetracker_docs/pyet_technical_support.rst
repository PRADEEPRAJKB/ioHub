would be very welcome and can be sent to [XXX@XXXXXXX, should a user group be set=up??].

Note that support for the pyEyeTracker interface is not the responsibility
of any eye tracker manufacturer that integration exists with pyEyeTracker for. Please use the pyEyeTracker 
mailing list / forum and post any support questions you have in the appropraite section. If the question is specific to a particular
interface implementation, please post accordingly.  

If you believe you have found an issue with the module, have questions regarding its use, 
or have an eye tracker that is not supported by the interface that you would like to be, please visit
the user forum and post your comment or question
there. It is always good to first:

    * check if someone has aleady asked your question and if it has been
      answered by seraching the forum itself.
     
If you are not able to find the answer you are looking for, feel free to post
your question or comment. Someone will get back to you as soon as possible;
