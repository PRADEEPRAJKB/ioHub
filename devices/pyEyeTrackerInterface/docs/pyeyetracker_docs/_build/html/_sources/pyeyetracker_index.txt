pyEyeTracker : Model Independent, Cross-Platform, Eye Tracker Interface for Python
***********************************************************************************

Welcome to the home of pyEyeTracker, a free, open source, eye tracker interface for Python providing a consistent API 
regardless of the eye tracker being used. 

pyEyeTracker was born from necessity, based on the ongoing work of the COGAIN Technical Committee on Eye Data Quality, 
the need for a common interface to multiple eye tracking systems for use during testing because apparent. After discuss
it was agreed that this common interface would ideally be written in a freely available, cross platform, and well known,
programming environment. There was also the desire for the programming environment to have an existing, mature, 
experiment creation tool, that the eye tracker interface could be used with. Finally, the programming environemnt needs to support
efficient access to C libries, while also being easy to learn for end users.

Well, Python fit the bill perfectly for the proramming language and thanks to PsychoPy |TM|, the requirement set was complete!

pyEyeTracker literally was just born, and is still in early infancy, requiring some nurchuring and attention
to enshure it starts off on the right foot. Fortunately it is a baby that seem to have, for the most part, a lot
of people that are interested and care about seeing it grow up. That includes eye tracking users and eye tracking 
manufacturers. We are in a fortunate situation that we need to take advantage of by working together to get something 
incredible done!
