The Eye Tracker Interface for Python that Cross Boundaries
==========================================================

Welcome to the home of **pyEyeTracker**, a *free*, *open source*, eye tracker
interface for Python providing a *consistent API* that supports *multiple eye
tracking systems*. 

pyEyeTracker was born from necessity. Based on the ongoing work of the `COGAIN
Technical Committee on Eye Data Quality <http://www.cogain.org/info/accuracy>`_, 
the need for a common interface to multiple eye tracking systems along with a
single experiment presentation and control package for use during testing
became apparent.

After discussion it was agreed that this common interface would ideally be
written in a freely available, cross platform, and well known, programming
language. There was also the desire for the programming environment to 
have an existing, mature, experiment creation tool which the eye tracker
interface could be used with. Finally, the programming environemnt needed
to support efficient access to C libries when needed, while also being 
easy to learn for end users.

Well, `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ fit the bill perfectly for the 
proramming language and thanks to `PsychoPy <http://www.psychopy.org>`_, 
the requirement set was complete!

pyEyeTracker was literally just born, and is still in early infancy, requiring
some nurchuring and attention to enshure it starts off on the right foot.
Fortunately it is a baby that seems to have, for the most part, a lot
of people that are interested and care about seeing it grow up. 
That includes eye tracking users and eye tracking manufacturers. We are
in a fortunate situation that we should take advantage of by working together
to get something incredible done! 

Please see the overview section of the documentation for a current
status of the project.
