the module, are free of charge and free to use as long as the terms of 
the license are followed. The pyEyeTracker module and any integration files
are provided under the BSD GNU version 3 or higher license. A copy of this

Any vendor specific library files used to access a specific eye tracker
are licensed under the license specified by that eye tracker manufacturer. 
You should check those details out for the eye tracker you use. To ease the 
installation process for end users, in some cases the eye tracker manufacturer 
has agreed that their eye tracker library can be included with the pyEyeTracker distrbution. 
Other eye tracking companies have requested that the normal procedure be followed for a user
of their software library and therefore you will need to contact your eye tracker supplier
or follow the procedure they outline to obtain the necessary dependant files to include
with the pyEyeTracker interface.
