The design and implemenation of the pyEyeTracker project should be credited to many people,
the following being some of the key contributors to date, in alphabetical order:

* Josh Borah
* Denis A. Engemann
* Kenneth Homqvist
* Markus Joos
* Fiona Mulvey
* Marcus Nystrom
* Sol Simpson


For contributors towards specific eye tracker interface implementations, please see the :ref:`pyet_eyetracker_models`.

We hope that this list grows as time continues.

The pyEyeTracker team would like to thank the incredible support that many academic researchers have providered towards the overall
COGAIN Data Standards initiative as well as to the pyEyeTracker specification. Furthermore, we would like to thank
so many of the eye tracker manufacturer's that show continued support towards the standardization initiative, as well a their help and 
support in providing the necessary technical details required for us to integrate their eye trackers
with the pyEyeTracker module. It is this type of partnership and forward thinking that makes this type of project possible,
and all involved should be applauded for their efforts and input.
The manufactures include (in alphabetical order):
    * ASL
    * Chronos
    * Innovative Minds
    * LC Technologies
    * SMI
    * SR Research Ltd

Finally, we would also like to thank 'Jon Peirce <http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/research/vision/jwp/>'_ for the years of effort he has put 
into heading the development of the open source PsychoPy project. Without his effort and the other 
'contributors to the PsychoPy project <http://www.psychopy.org/credits.html>'_ over the last 6 years, 
there would not be such a complete and functional open source psychology package built with an open source programming environment
that is available to all researchers. His team's efforts on PsychoPy should be an insparation 
for how the future of scientific tool development can work.
