Issues:
    
   1) Randomization of condition file does not seem to be working.
   2) targets are distorted; the defualt center color is not shown and the fill has splines through it. 
       This just started happenning Mat 21st, so I did something to an OpenGL setting or such. 
   3) Data saving is not how I trhink it should be. Input would be good. Maybe it is fine.
